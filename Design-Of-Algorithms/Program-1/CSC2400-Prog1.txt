a. Given an input list and a target element, output the index of the third occurence
of that element in the list. If there are not three occurences, display a message.

//INPUT: inputList = [4, 8, 1, 1, 5, 3, 0, 5, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 5]
//OUTPUT: index of third occurence of 0

STEP 1 currentIndex <- 0
STEP 2 occurence <- 0
STEP 3 targetElement <- 0
STEP 4 while currentIndex < 13 do
	if inputList[currentIndex] = targetElement do
		occurence <- occurence + 1
	if occurence = 3 do	
		display currentIndex
		occurence <- occurence + 1
	currentIndex <- currentIndex +1
STEP 5 if occurence != 3 do
	display "There are not 3 occurences of 0 in the list."

STEP 6 return 0
